To create a VirtualEnv you can use the prepare.sh bash script.
If you don't want to use it, you will need Python2.7 and the requirements.txt.
you can do this by executing:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Note:
	If you have multiple versions of python, you might need to install the requirements with pip2 instead of pip


Once you have sourced the VirtualEnv, verify that the execute script has u+x permissions

To execute:
./execute.py --help
./execute.py --server-url localhost --server-port 8080 -o results

With this last command you will execute all the tests inside the tests folder (Actually all the tests located in the project, but we only have tests in that folder.)
The xml results will be in the results folder and if any of the tests fail the StackTraces will be shown in the terminal.

As of today these tests take around 30 seconds to finish because of the concurrent game creation test.
